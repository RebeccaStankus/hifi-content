# Sit
## Description
Make any entity sittable whether it's a chair, bench, couch, log, or even a tree stump. One chair per entity.

To allow the user to sit when clicking on the entity to which the scripts are attached, set `canClickOnModelToSit` to `true` in the attached entity's `userData`. 

## Setup
1. Add sitClient.js as script to entity
2. Add sitServer.js as server script to entity

## Known issues
### The heartbeat system doesn't work.
If a server heartbeat fails (i.e. a user disconnects while they're sitting), the Sittable UI won't re-appear on that seat for any other users unless they restart their client. This has been broken since Sit V1.

### A 1.1x height multiplier may not always sit the user at the right spot.
During `calculateSeatCenterPositionForPinningAvatarHips()`, we use a y-offset of 1.1x the y-dimension of the seat to determine where to place the avatar's hips. This multiplier may not always be correct for all seats.

### Solution to other entities taking the "Click to Sit" click events
Collisions with other entity's invisible collision hulls sometimes make it difficult to sit. Ensure entities near sit cubes have the property `ignorePickIntersection: true`.

### Sit animation does not apply to an avatar using a different default animation
Animation that is applied before sitting is applied while in the chair and continues after standup.

### Unreliable method for making sure we know where the floor is when we standup
In the current Sit code architecture, we begin sitting in a seat by using the position of the clicked "sit cube", and then adding some constant to figure out where your hips should go during the sit animation. To figure out where to position the avatar upon stand-up, we explored saving the Y position of the avatar before sitting down, but there are several cases where that saved Y position might not be a useful reference - consider the user standing on a different vertical plane as the chair.
In this version of the code, we add a small, arbitrary value to the Y position of the user when standing. This should generally take care of the problems we were seeing with users stuck in the floor. However, there still exists the possibility of an edge case where the small increase in Y position is enough to force the user through a room's ceiling.

### Future features
Configurable variables:
- Custom animations specified via userData
- All configurable variables specified via userData

## Sit Configurations
### Configurable adjustments in Create Mode
- Adjust seat center - update the "Pivot" (to adjust the "registrationPoint" entity property) Ex: a stool for an avatar to sit in the middle on top, Pivot = { x: 0.5, y: 1.0, z: 0.5 }

### Configurable variables in userData
- Can click on chair to sit boolean in userData
