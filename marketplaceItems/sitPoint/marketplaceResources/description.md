**Create a place to sit anywhere!**

**The Sit Point makes it easy:**

1. Place the Sit Point where you'd like to create a seat

2. Click on the "Click to Sit" in Desktop or Trigger on the "Trigger to Sit" in HMD

3. Hold a movement key or joystick to stand up

Make any asset sittable whether it's a chair, bench, couch, log, or even a tree stump.

Happy sitting!

**Create Mode Update:** Sit Point is now visible in Create Mode for easier editting.
